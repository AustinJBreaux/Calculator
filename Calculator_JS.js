/*
Notes:
Create all calculator operations:
    Add
    Subtract
    Multiple
    Divide
    Operate - Takes an operator (like the above) and 2 numbers, then uses that
        operator on those numbers
    Clear - Clear all data stored
    Decimals (Round to the 10th place, and only allow one per number)
    Equals
    Positive/negative integers
    Storage of the display value for the operate button
    users should be able to string operators (like 5 + 4 + 3 etc)
    First number should interact directly with the second, no order of operations 
        bullshit (So 5 + 5 - 2 * 3 = 24)
    If an operator is called without a following number, delete the operator
        and display the first number
        Snarky message if someone tries to divide by 0
    Toggle button for allowing keyboard controls
    Backspace button
